Built this project with Angular and Firebase for backend support. This is a simple web application that allows a user to search for Wiki articles as well as GIPHY images. The application offers both quick and extended searches as well as a history page that shows pervious searches. All results are clickable links that take the user to a new page that corresponds to the Wiki page or the GIPHY image. Each searh function is a simple API call, and the code simply parses the result in a simplified way for the user. 

This project includes front end, backend, and UI design to create a fully functional Angular web application.
